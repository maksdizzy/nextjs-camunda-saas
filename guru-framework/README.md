## Introduction

## What is Guru Framework?

![guru_framework.png](guru_framework.png)

The **Guru Framework** is a next-generation development platform combining AI automation, Web3 integrations, and traditional business workflow orchestration into a unified, low-code experience.

Powered by top-tier open-source technologies—**Redash** (analytics), **Camunda BPMN** (workflow orchestration), **Thirdweb** (blockchain & wallets), **Next.js** (dynamic interfaces), and **Ethereum ETL** (data pipelines)—Guru enables developers to quickly build intelligent, event-driven applications and autonomous agent workflows.

### Guru Famework, how it looks?:

The best way to check and see for yourself: [dex.guru](https://dex.guru/)

What you see in DexGuru is not a custom monolith—it’s a reproducible application powered entirely by the Guru Framework. This means:
- **You can build your own DexGuru-grade apps** by combining analytics, AI agents, and Web3 logic using the same low-code system.
- The **data warehouse, agent orchestration, and UI** are all modular and open for you to use.
- Every builder has access to the same tools, flow engine, and runtime powering DexGuru.

Explore the demo, imagine the possibilities, and start building.

### Key Developer Benefits:

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly assemble powerful workflows with intuitive low-code tools.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Focus on business logic and innovation, not infrastructure.
- **Future-Proof & AI-Ready:** Integrates seamlessly with emerging standards like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, preparing your apps for agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions.
- **Unified Ecosystem:** Guru apps automatically become part of the broader **GURU Network**, benefiting from shared resources, interoperability, and ecosystem growth.

Build smarter, scale faster, and stay ahead with Guru Framework.

## Components

###  Engine
Located in the `engine` directory, this is the core of the framework, managing the automation and orchestration of blockchain business processes.

### Flow API
The Flow API in the `flow_api` directory provides endpoints for creating and managing workflows programmatically.

### Telegram Bot Unified Composer
Integrated into the framework, this tool allows the creation of Telegram bots to control and manage processes.

### Smart Contracts
Found in the `contracts` directory, these handle secure and efficient decentralized application operations.

### GUI
The `gui` directory contains the user interface components, offering an intuitive graphical interface for managing processes.

### External Workers
Defined in the `external_workers` directory, these provide non-custodial execution and compute services.

### Orchestration Workers Contracts
Located in the `orchestration_workers` directory, these contracts facilitate workflow orchestration.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Guru Framework, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dex-guru/guru-framework
    cd guru-framework
    ```

2. **Create the `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      engine:
        build:
          context: ./engine
        container_name: chainflow-engine
        environment:
          INSCRIPTIONS_HISTORY_ENABLED: 'false'
          RABBITMQ_ENABLED: 'false'
        ports:
          - '8080:8080'
        networks:
          - chainflow-net

      gui:
        build:
          context: ./gui
        container_name: chainflow-gui
        ports:
          - '3000:3000'
        networks:
          - chainflow-net

      external-workers:
        build:
          context: ./external_workers
        container_name: chainflow-external-workers
        environment:
          - WORKER_SCRIPTS=messaging/telegram_message_worker.py,testnet_arbitrage/get_last_price.py # Add more worker scripts as needed
          - CAMUNDA_URL=http://engine:8080/engine-rest
          - CAMUNDA_USER=demo
          - CAMUNDA_PASSWORD=demo
        networks:
          - chainflow-net
        volumes:
          - ./external_workers/envs:/app/envs # Mount the directory containing environment files
        depends_on:
          - engine

    networks:
      chainflow-net:
        driver: bridge
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Compose setup:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

#### Check Services

- **Engine:** Running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) - default user/pass is demo:demo
- **GUI:** Running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Workers:** Check workers running with `docker-compose ps`
```bash
➜  guru-framework git:(main) ✗ docker-compose ps
           Name                         Command               State           Ports

# Development Process Example: Arbitrage Bot

### Step-by-Step Guide:

Create Process in [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/):

Design your process in Camunda Modeler.
Save the BPMN file to engine/resources directory.

#### Create Non-Custodial External Worker in Python:

**Create Non-Custodial External Worker in Python:**
1. Create a Python script for the external worker.
2. Example code from `external_workers/testnet_arbitrage/get_last_price.py`:

```python
from camunda.external_task.external_task import ExternalTask, TaskResult
from camunda.external_task.external_task_worker import ExternalTaskWorker
import requests

def handle_task(task: ExternalTask) -> TaskResult:
    # Your task logic here
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/get-price')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        price = response.json().get('price')
        print(f"Retrieved price: {price}")
        return task.complete({"price": price})
    else:
        return task.failure(error_message="Failed to fetch price")

worker = ExternalTaskWorker(worker_id="worker-id", base_url="http://localhost:8080/engine-rest")
worker.subscribe("get-last-price", handle_task)
```

### Create Postgres Model Code:

1. Define your database models.
2. Example code for an arbitrage bot model:
```python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class ArbitrageBot(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'arbitrage_bots'
    id = Column(Integer, primary key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = Column(String)
    profit = Column(Float)

engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname')
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```
